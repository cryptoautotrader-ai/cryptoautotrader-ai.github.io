This software is capable of fully autonomous trading on popular cryptocurrency exchanges, once set up correctly.

Currently, it utilizes several naive approaches to spot trading (
either [price-related crossovers](https://trendspider.com/learning-center/moving-average-crossover-strategies/) or
GPT-powered analytics is an option); however, due to it being highly customizable, one could squeeze better results out
of it.

This software is open source under a permissive [License](LICENSE), and it's FREE.

*Support for older Python versions is not guaranteed, but deemed probable for 3.10 and newer.*

*Console only app (no GUI, but user-friendly messages).*

## Features

* Test mode to only test the prediction API â€“ no trades would be made (suitable for LLM APIs; Pandas â€“ not so much)

* LLM connection is through an API (any 'openai' library supported API's)

* This script endlessly places buy and sell orders based on predictive modeling (with calculations of price and
  amount, see function `prepare_order` of class `App` in module [run.py](run.py)):

  a. Price for 'BUY' orders is `((bid + ask) / 2) * (1 - parametrized premium)`,

  b. Price for 'SELL' orders is `((bid + ask) / 2) * (1 + parametrized premium)`,

  c. Amount to buy is `parametrized reinvestment_rate x free quote token balance / price buy`

  d. Amount to sell is `parametrized reinvestment_rate x free base token balance`

* This software operates under the assumption that one can only use one's own capital

* This software uses default Python floating point real numbers (`float`) for prices & volumes

* This software is shipped with substantial error handling. The script is designed to run indefinitely.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, one would need to add the following environment variables to the `.env` file/-s (the currently
programmed logic is in two separate files for predictive and running modules, but it doesn't have to be).

All fields must be filled with valid strings. Fields that end with '_JSON' must be filled with valid json data strings.
`.env` files must be linked in the starting sequence (e.g., via command line arguments or as Default strings in the code).

### Running module variables

*It is easier to create a new `main.env` as per [example](main.env.example), that has included explanations for each
variable, as well*

`EXCHANGE_API_KEY` â€“ API to access cryptoexchange

`EXCHANGE_SECRET` â€“ API to access cryptoexchange

`EXCHANGE_PASSPHRASE` â€“ API to access cryptoexchange

`ALGORITHM_TRUST_PERCENTAGE` â€“ Reinvestment rate â€“ how much of one's free balance (per token) is to be used for spot
orders (*default is 0.5, can be a real value in range [0.0;1.0]*)

`BASE_SLEEP_TIME` â€“ sleep time in seconds between program cycles

`CANCEL_ORDER_LIMIT` â€“ how many cycles to wait before cancelling all open orders (cancels orders on achieving LIMIT)

`RETRIES_BEFORE_SLEEP_LIMIT` â€“ how many times to retry without sleeping (only unknown errors)

`DATA_VECTOR_LENGTH` â€“ Number of past-data points to use in predictive modeling

`DEFAULT_EXCHANGE_NAME` â€“ ccxt supported exchange name

`DEFAULT_EXCHANGE_FEE` â€“ price fraction that is collected as order fee by crypto exchange

`PREMIUM_OVER_EXCHANGE_FEES` â€“ any positive real number (would be kept at 0.0, to only account for exchange fee without
additional premium/discount on bid/ask)

`MIN_TRANSACTION_VALUE_IN_BASE` â€“ Minimal amount to spot-order base currency for a given trading pair

`TIMEFRAME` â€“ Depending on cryptoexchange, this value can be set as either of: `1m`, `3m`, `5m`, `10m`, `15m`, `30m`,
`4h`, `8h`, `12h`, `1w`. See ccxt docs or exchange API for correct info.

`TRADING_PAIR` â€“ What to spot trade (e.g., `XMR/USDT`). NOTE: One must have both of these two tokens in any amount in
their portfolio, before an order can be placed (If that isn't the case, the script will show a
`ProbablyAIButCouldBeAnything` exception with the ticker of the token one doesn't own).

### Predictive module variables

*(easier to create a new `llm.env` or `probability.env`, or `pandas.env` as per [example 1](llm.env.example) or 
[example 2](probability_llm.env.example), or [example 3](pandas.env.example))*

`DEFAULT_PREDICTION_API` â€“ either `LLM` or `PROBABILITY_LLM`, or `PANDAS` is supported

#### Case 1

If `DEFAULT_PREDICTION_API=PANDAS`, then:

`PREDICTION_OPERATIONAL_PRICE_TYPE` â€“ stockstats.StockDataFrame supported indicator or price type (e.g., `middle_2_sma`
or `close`). Numbers cannot exceed `DATA_VECTOR_LENGTH`.

`PREDICTION_INDICATORS_JSON` â€“ valid json array of stockstats.StockDataFrame supported indicators (e.g.,
`["close_5,15_kama","middle_15_ema"]`). Numbers cannot exceed `DATA_VECTOR_LENGTH`.

`PREDICTION_GLOBAL_SIGNAL_LAG` â€“ integer value of 1 or greater (cannot exceed `DATA_VECTOR_LENGTH`).

#### Case 2

If `DEFAULT_PREDICTION_API=LLM`, then:

`LLM_BASE_URL` â€“ base URL for API of your chosen LLM,

`LLM_API_KEY` â€“ your LLM api key,

`LLM_MODEL` â€“ model to use,

Also if `DEFAULT_PREDICTION_API=PROBABILITY_LLM`, then additional:

`LOWER_PROB` â€“ Sell signal, if lower than (default 20)

`UPPER_PROB` â€“ Buy signal, if higher than (default 80).

## Deployment

*Steps 3 and 4 are irrelevant, if [.Dockerfile](.Dockerfile) is used*

Running with a `-d` or `--dashboard` flag will result in forwarding program output to a local flask server of a Dash app (only supported for `run` mode).
This dashboard option will also show a plot of transaction cost for successfully placed orders (upward transaction cost trend coincides with portfolio estimation growth, so it's useful info).

#### 1

Create `.env` file/-s:

Parametrization of this software is achieved via the means of environment variables, specifically through the use of
`.env` **files**. So the files are essential.

#### 2

Link these `.env` files in [Python module run.py](run.py) either as command line arguments, or in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` section as
`DEFAULT_PREDICTION_ENVIRONMENT_FILENAME` and `DEFAULT_MAIN_ENVIRONMENT_FILENAME` constants. They don't *have* to be separate files, but
at least **a** filename must be supplied of a file containing the required Environment variables.
Not specifying a `<something>.env` file would result in scanning the literal file with the path '.env' in the same
directory as the script.

### Unix operating systems (GNU/Linux, macOS, ...)

#### 3

The required packages are installed with:

    pip install --root-user-action=ignore --upgrade pip && pip install --root-user-action=ignore -r requirements.txt

#### 4

Run from inside project directory:

Required:

Specify either `run` or `test` command to run the script in main mode or test mode, respectively.

Optional arguments: 
* `-p` or `--predictions` â€“ specify `.env` file with prediction API needed info
* `-e` or `--env` â€“ specify `.env` file with exchange API needed info

    
    python3 run.py run -e main.env -p probability_llm.env

Alternatively run from outside project directory (change `<path_to_`run.py`>` to actual path):

    sudo python3 <path_to_`run.py`> run -e main.env -p probability_llm.env

*Administrator password might be prompted to enter*

***Run in test mode***:

    python3 run.py test -p probability_llm.env

***Run in test mode (outside project directory)***:

    sudo python3 <path_to_`run.py`> test -p probability_llm.env


### Windows

Untested. Windows users must be smart enough to figure out the quirks.

### Docker

Untested! The [.Dockerfile](.Dockerfile) is shipped with essential commands.

## Appendix

Currently, the usage of a lagged crossover is hardcoded as per the vision of the developer; however, altering that is very achievable:
updated can be the `predict_pandas` function in module `predict.py` â€“ specifically, the way that lists `signals` and
`anti_signals` are filled. The part `{"_delta" * self.wait_for_n_signal_lags}` just needs to be eliminated, as do any
subsequent mentions of `self.wait_for_n_signal_lags`.

As is known, any trading system that utilizes Technical analysis techniques would be better off in markets with high
liquidity. With regard to this, it would be wise to pick trading pairs that are high in trading volume. However, other reasons can be considered; thus making the liquidity-related suggestion moot.

[This absolute unit of a Jupyter Notebook](test_xmrusdt.ipynb) is my gift to the noob Technical analysis enthusiasts.
It can help them backtest their crossover strategies AND the code happens to be very compatible with this **Crypto
Autotrader**.
